Housing societies have a lot of visitors day in and day out. Keeping a track of each and every visitor is important for security reasons. Most of the thefts happen because the intruders were not recorded by the security guards. It is very difficult to manage such a huge amount of data manually. Hence, our system focuses on creating a complete housing society management system â€“ where the security guards can add the visitors according to the residents and the residents can also keep a track of who entered their premises. Any suspicious or recurring activity can be traced down with the help of this web app. 
Through this system, we also aim to have a common forum for society related information and notices so that the residents find it easy to communicate with the admins and the overall social well- being of these housing complexes can be better
