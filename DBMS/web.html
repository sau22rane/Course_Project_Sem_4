Let us start with the IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING SAFETY<br/><br/>

Broadly speaking, safety and security is everyoneâ€™s responsibility. Your support and adoption is for success of the initial set of safety guidelines.<br/><br/>


1. Ensure additional caution while parking your vehicle or reversing it. Speed of 10 km/Hr is recommended for driving within society premises. Do keep your mobile away while parking or driving.<br/><br/>


2. Children Safety is of utmost importance. Accompany your child, who is below 12 years in High speed elevators.<br/><br/>


3. Follow Swimming pool safety rules. For your benefits, rules are written near the entrance. If you do not find swimming pool attendant at any time, alert the Security immediately.<br/><br/>


4. Hon. Members are requested to keep common lobby areas free of any furniture items, cycles or any other material. Fire safety rules are very clear and the penalties involved are huge to be borne by the society.<br/><br/>


5. Hon. Members are requested to ensure that any maintenance work in duct areas is performed by trained persons only with the proper safety gear. Safety gear includes proper head protection as well safety hooks for protection from fall between the duct areas.<br/><br/>


6. Make sure that you allow any Salesperson or courier to visit your flat only if you are certain. You can always ask couriers to deposit the package at the security gate and security can hand it over to you later. If you discover that sales person has tricked you and reached your flat somehow, please close the door and alert the security.<br/><br/>


7. If you find any intruder please volunteer to inform the security immediately. Do not confront the person directly.<br/><br/>


8. Be aware of fire safety guidelines. We shall form a team of fire marshals and do plan to join as fires marshal. Make yourself aware with fire safety guidelines.<br/><br/> 


9. Society has honor of having many doctors and specialists as Hon. Members. Do take their help in cases of emergency.<br/><br/>
